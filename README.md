# SOEN691 Project
## Comparative study of Nipype and Spark performance for the efficient processing of neuroimaging data on large-scale parallel infrastructures

### Experiment 1: Simple binarization in Nipype and Spark
### Experiment 2: K-means workflow in Nipype and Spark
### Experiment 3: Reimplementation of an existing fMRIPrep workflow in Apache Spark
- The fMRIPrep workflow selected is anatomical preprocessing without reconall (command-line call to be added here)
- Spark implementation can be found under `sparkprep.py`
